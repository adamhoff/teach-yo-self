# Phaser JS

[Phaser JS](http://phaser.io/) is a free open source framework for Canvas and WebGL powered browser games.

The reason I chose Phaser JS for the teach-yo-self project is because I am a gamer at heart and I've always dreamed of creating my own game. Phaser is an excellent starting point for anyone looking to make their first game.
